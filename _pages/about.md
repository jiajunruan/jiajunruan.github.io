Hi, I am Jiajun Ruan. I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Minnesota (UMN), starting in Spring 2026. My research interest lies in the post-training phase of Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on enhancing their reliability and robustness. I am currently exploring techniques such as LLM unlearning and reinforcement learning (RL).

Music has been a significant part of my life—I’ve been playing the cello for over ten years and have had the pleasure of performing with several orchestras. Besides music, I’m also passionate about sports, especially badminton and basketball, which I enjoy playing regularly.
