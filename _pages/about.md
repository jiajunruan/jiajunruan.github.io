I’m Jiajun Ruan, currently a senior undergraduate student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) and also pursuing my Master of Engineering (MEng) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://illinois.edu/)).

Music has been a significant part of my life—I’ve been playing the cello for over ten years and have had the pleasure of performing with several orchestras. Besides music, I’m also passionate about sports, especially badminton and basketball, which I enjoy playing regularly.

As for academics, my research interests lie in the field of machine learning.
