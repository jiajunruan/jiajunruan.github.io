Hi, I am **Jiajun Ruan**, an incoming Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.umn.edu/) at the [University of Minnesota (UMN)](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), starting in Spring 2026.  
I am fortunate to be **advised by [Prof. Mingyi Hong](https://people.ece.umn.edu/~mhong/mingyi.html)**.  

My research interest lies in the **post-training phase of Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with a focus on enhancing their **reliability and robustness**. Currently, I am exploring techniques such as **LLM unlearning** and **reinforcement learning (RL)** to improve model alignment and generalization.

Prior to joining UMN, I completed my **Master of Engineering** in [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/),  
where I was **advised by [Prof. Francis Y. Yan](https://fyy.cs.illinois.edu/)**.  
During my time at UIUC, I worked on applying **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to **network systems**, focusing on enhancing automation and reasoning capabilities in network management.

Music has been a significant part of my life — I’ve been playing the **cello** for over ten years and have had the pleasure of performing with several orchestras.  
Besides music, I’m also passionate about **sports**, especially **badminton** and **basketball**, which I enjoy playing regularly.
