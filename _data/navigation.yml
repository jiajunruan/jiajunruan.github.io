# The following is the order of the links in the header of the website.

# Changing the order here will adjust the order and you can also add additional
# links. Removing a link prevents it from showing in the header, but does not
# prevent it from being included in the site.

  # The following menu items are temporarily hidden. To restore them,
  # remove the leading '#' characters for each block and restart Jekyll,
  # or restore from git (e.g. `git checkout -- _data/navigation.yml`).
